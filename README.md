# leaflet-challenge

## Overview

This project maps out earthquakes using Leaflet from the following source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.geojson

Earthquakes are marked as bubbles where size of the bubble is correlated with magnitude and color reflects the depth within the earth at which the earthquake occurred. The logic.js file details how the code imports tile layers, constructs the legend, and brings everything together in a clean, interactive map.
